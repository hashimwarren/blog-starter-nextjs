# Project: Convert HTML5UP Dopetrope to Next.js with Shadcn Components

This is a conversion project to take a static HTML template and convert it into a Next.js application using shadcn components. The project will involve setting up the Next.js environment, creating a layout, converting HTML pages to React components, and ensuring the design is consistent with the original template.

The design reference screenshot is available at: screenshot.png

# Conversion Plan

1. Analyze the HTML structure of the Dopetrope template html5up-dopetrope, and the screenshot.png

2. Lay out how the design can be turned into sensible components.

3. See the installed shadcn components available in nextjs-dopetrop/src/components/ui
